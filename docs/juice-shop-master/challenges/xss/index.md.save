# Client-side XSS Challenge

:::warning Educational Use Only

This challenge is documented strictly for educational and ethical purposes within the OWASP Juice Shop training environment only.

Do NOT attempt this on real systems.

:::

This challenge demonstrates how client-side input validation can be bypassed in the OWASP Juice Shop application. By intercepting and modifying the registration request, malicious input can be injected and executed in the browser.

## Prerequisites

To complete this challenge, the following requirements must be fulfilled:

- OWASP Juice Shop is running locally on http://localhost:3000
- Burp Suite is installed and configured as a proxy
- Browser traffic is routed through Burp Suite
- Basic understanding of HTTP requests and client-side validation

### 1. Client-side XSS Protection

#### Category:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) / Client-Side Input Validation

## Prerequisites

- OWASP Juice Shop running locally or on a VM
- Web browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended)
- Basic knowledge of web security concepts
- Browser developer tools access (F12)

## Step-by-Step Exploitation

1. Open the Juice Shop application
2. Navigate to...
3. Enter the following payload:
   ```html
   <script>alert(1)</script>

#### Exploitation Steps

1. Register a new user inside Juice Shop but before clicking “Register,” turn on Intercept in Burp Suite.

2. Click Register, allowing Burp to intercept the POST /api/user request.

3. Send the intercepted request to Repeater.

4. From the Scoreboard hint, copy the provided payload:
```
'<iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">'
```
5. Replace the email field in the JSON request with this payload.

6. Escape internal quotes to keep JSON valid:
```
'<iframe src=\"javascript:alert(`xss`)\">'
```
7. Click Send in Repeater to forward the modified request.

8. The browser processes the injected payload, triggering the XSS and solving the challenge.

#### Risks & Impact

- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in a victim’s browser

- Session hijacking

- Account takeover

- Phishing, redirects, or keylogging

- Full compromise of user interaction inside the application

#### Result

The challenge is solved once the JavaScript alert executes successfully, proving that client-side protection was bypassed.
