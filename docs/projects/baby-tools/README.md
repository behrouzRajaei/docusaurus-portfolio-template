git clone https://github.com:behrouzRajaei/baby-tools-shop.git
cd baby-tools-shop
```

# Prepare the environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env

docker build -t babyshop-app .
docker run -it -p 8025:8000 --env-file .env \
-v $(pwd)/project_images:/app/project_images \
babyshop-app
```

# The app will be available at:

```
http://`<server-ip>`:8025
```
---

## 4. Usage

### Admin access

# Create a superuser:
```bash
docker exec -it `<container_name>` python manage.py createsuperuser
```
# Login at:
```
http://`<server-ip>`:8025/admin
```
# From here you can:

- Add categories

- Add products

- Manage users

### Configuration

# All sensitive settings are stored in .env. Adjust values like:

- SECRET_KEY

- DEBUG

- ALLOWED_HOSTS

- Database settings

### Container configuration

- To stop the container:
```bash
docker ps
docker stop `<container_id>`
```

## 5. Documentation

- Project and code documentation is provided inside this README.md.

- Language: English (as required by checklist).

---

## 6. Security Notes

- No passwords, tokens, or sensitive data are stored in the repository.

- Example data is only provided via .env.example.

- No login credentials or server IPs are committed.

---

## 7. Code Conventions

- Environment variables use UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORE
  Example: SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, ALLOWED_HOSTS

- Always reference variables with `${VAR_NAME}` (not $VAR_NAME) to avoid errors.

- Always use `${VAR_NAME}` in configs.

- Sensitive configs (tokens, passwords) are only stored in .env, never in the codebase.

---

## 8. Testing

Before submission, ensure:

- The app runs locally before containerization.

- The Docker container builds successfully.

- The app is reachable at http://`<server-ip>`:8025
